# Github Finder

> Small web app that allows you to search for github users, and view some details. This project was built on the MERN stack.

It's a very simple application that demonstrates the basics of using the React framework. [Try it out here](https://githubfinder89.netlify.com).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm start

# App runs on http://localhost:3000
```

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
